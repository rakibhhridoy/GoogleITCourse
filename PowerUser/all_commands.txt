			*Devices and Drivers*

Driver ---Used to help our hardware devices interact with our OS.
Win ---Device Manager


Linux

ls -l /dev

Character Devices ---like a keyboard or a mouse, transmit data character by character   --c
/dev/sdc
Block Devices ---like USB drives,hard drives and CDROMs, transfer blocks of data: a data block is just a unit of data storage. --b
/dev/sdb or /dev/sda



Security Patch ---Software that's meant to fix up a security hole.
Windows Update Client Service





				*FileSystem*

---Used to keep track of files and file storage on a disk

Windows ---NTFS
Linux ---ext4
USB drive ---NTFS formatted (We can use that usb in both Linux & Windows)
USB drive ---ext4 (can be use only Linux)
USB drive ---FAT32 (can be use Linux, Windows & Mac)


=== Disk Anatomy

Partition ---The piece of a disk that you can manage.
Partition Table ---Tells the OS how the disk is partitoned.

Master Boot Record (MBR) ---2TB max volume size | Primary partitions
   |     |     |     |
  P1    P2    P3    P4  ---P= partition
   |
   Extended
	| 
	Logical


GUID Partition Table (GPT) ---2TB or greater volume size | one type of partition | unlimited partitions

cmd===

Diskpart
> list disk
> select disk 1
> clean
> create partition primary
> select partition 1
> active
> format FS=NTFS label=m-thumb-drive




Linux

sudo parted -l
sudo parted [Path]
sudo parted /dev/sdb

(parted) print
(parted) mklabel gpt
(parted) print
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 5GiB
(parted) mkpart [type] [FS] [Start] [End]
(parted) quit

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1




=== Mounting Unmounting FS

Mounting ---Making something accessible to the computer,like a filesystem or a hard disk
Unmounting ---Reverse or vice versa

Linux 

mount /dev/sdb /my_usb
cd /my_usb

umount /dev/sdb








=== Swap

Virtual Memory ---How our OS provides the physical memory available in our computer (like RAM) to the applications that run on the computer.

To see pages in Windows:

Control Panel >> System & Security >> System >> Advanced system Settings >> Advanced >> Settings >> Advanced >> Change


Linux
Swap Space ---In Linux, the dedicated area of the hard drive used for virtual memory.


sudo parted /dev/sdb

(parted) print
(parted) mkpart primary linux-swap 5GiB 100% 
(parted) print
(parted) quit

sudo mkswap /dev/sdb2
sudo swapon /dev/sdb2




=== Files

Master File Table ---Windows use MFT to handle file data,file metadata, file system.


NTFS(HDD/SSD)---- MFT ---- File1 File2 File3
			     |     |     |
			    MFT	  MFT   MFT
			   Entry Entry Entry

   MFT
- File Name
- Timestamp
- Permissons
- Compression
- Location
- Etc...

When file is deleted File1 MFT Entry will be -Free



Shortcut - Symbolic link
Shortcut - Hard Link


create a shortcut of any file. Say file1.txt has file1_shortcut.lnk

cd [Dir]
notepad.exe file1_shortcut.lnk
mklink file1_symlink file1.txt
mklink [Symbolic Link File Name] [File]
notepad.exe [File]      ---now it will show the linked content.
mklink /H [Hardlink Link File Name] [File]



Linux
In linux, an inode stores everything about a file, except for the filename and the file data.

Softlink ----- File ----- HDD


Hardlink ----- inode ----- inode table ----- HDD
				     File-----|

ls -l file.txt
ln -s file.txt file_softlink
ls -l
ln file.txt file_hardlink
ls -l file.txt  ---2 means one link

Windows - Parent Process to child process ask
	- Child Process are application

notepad.exe    ---Here parent process is powershell and child is notepad application


ps ax

ps -ef ---e flag will show process of other users, f is for full processes
UID  ---User ID, who launched the process
PPID ---which launched the process
C    ---number of children process has

lsof ---open file process


 





			*Remote Connection*


To have a remote connection we need:
1. having a user with a pass in that computer
2. knowing that computer's IP address



putty.exe -ssh [username]@[hostIP] [port]   ---basically port 22

For GUI, We can use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Microsoft Terminal Services Client

msctsc.exe    ---Used to create RDP connections to remote computers

enable RDP-
This PC >> Properties >> Remote Settings >> Allow remote connection >> Apply >> OK




Linux

ssh [username]@[hostIP]



=== Remote Connection File Transfer

PuTTY Secure Copy Client

pscp.exe [File] [username]@[hostIP]:[Path to paste]

Shared Folder
net share ShareMe=[Folder] /grant:everyone,full




SCP ---Secure Copy

scp [File] [username]@[hostIP]:[Path to paste]





=== Log

eventvwr.msc

create custom logs >> error >> time >> create



Linux

ls /var/log

auth.log ---authorization and security-related events are logged here
kern.log ---kernel message are logged here
dmesg    ---system startup message are logged here.we can diagnose boot up issues
syslog   ---all system log



live log entry view:
tail -f /var/log/syslog

and now run the application.
